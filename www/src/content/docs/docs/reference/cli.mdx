<Section type="about">
The CLI helps you manage your SST apps.

```bash title="Install"
curl -fsSL https://ion.sst.dev/install | bash
```

:::note
The CLI currently supports macOS, Linux, and WSL. Windows support is coming soon.
:::

Once installed you can run the commands using.

```bash
sst [command]
```

The CLI takes a few global flags. For example, the deploy command takes the `--stage` flag

```bash
sst deploy --stage=production
```
</Section>

---

## Global Flags

### stage
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">string</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Set the stage the CLI is running on.

```bash frame="none"
sst [command] --stage=production
```

If the stage is not passed in, then the CLI will:

1. Uses the username on the local machine.
   - If the username is `root`, `admin`, `prod`, `dev`, `production`, then it will prompt for a stage name.
2. Store this in the `.sst/stage` file and reads from it in the future.

This stored stage is called your personal stage.

:::tip
The stage that is stored in the `.sst/stage` file is called your personal stage.
:::
</Segment>

### verbose
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>

Enables verbose logging for the CLI output.

```bash
sst [command] --verbose
```

</Segment>

### help
<Segment>
<Section type="parameters">
<InlineSection>
**Type** <code class="primitive">boolean</code>
</InlineSection>
</Section>
Prints help for the given command.

```sh frame="none"
sst [command] --help
```

Or for the global help.

```sh frame="none"
sst --help
```
</Segment>

## Commands

### init
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst init
```
</Section>
Initialize a new project in the current directory. This will create a `sst.config.ts` and `sst install` your providers.

If this is run in a Next.js, Remix, or Astro project, it'll init SST in drop-in mode.
</Segment>

### dev
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst dev [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
The command to run
</Section>
Run your app in development mode. Optionally, pass in a command to start your frontend as well.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev
```

You can also pass in a command to start your frontend with it.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev next dev
```

To pass in a flag to your command, wrap it in quotes.

```bash frame="none"
sst dev "next dev --turbo"
```

Dev mode does a few things:

1. Starts a local server
2. Watches your app config and re-deploys your changes
3. Run your functions [Live](/docs/live/)
4. If you pass in a `command`, it'll:
   - Load your [linked resources](/docs/linking) in the environment
   - And run the command

:::note
If you run `sst dev` with a command, it will not print your function logs.
:::

If `sst dev` starts your frontend, it won't print logs from your SST app. We do this to prevent your logs from being too noisy. To view your logs, you can run `sst dev` in a separate terminal.

:::tip
You can start as many instances of `sst dev` in your app as you want.
:::

Starting multiple instances of `sst dev` in the same project only starts a single _server_. Meaning that the second instance connects to the existing one.

This is different from SST v2, in that you needed to run `sst dev` and `sst bind` for your frontend.
</Segment>

### deploy
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst deploy
```
</Section>
Deploy your application. By default, it deploys to your personal stage.

Optionally, deploy your app to a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst deploy --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### add
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst add <provider>
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">provider</code></p>
The provider to add.
</Section>
Adds a provider to your `sst.config.ts` and installs it. For example.

```bash frame="none"
sst add aws
```

Adds the following to your config.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  providers: {
    aws: true
  }
}
```

:::tip
You can get the name of a provider from the URL of the provider in the [Pulumi Registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/).
:::

Running `sst add aws` above is the same as adding the provider to your config and running `sst install`.
</Segment>

### install
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst install
```
</Section>
Installs the providers in your `sst.config.ts`. You'll need this command when:

1. You add a new provider to `providers` or `home` in your config.
2. Or, when you want to install new providers after you `git pull` some changes.

:::tip
The `sst install` command is similar to `npm install`.
:::

Behind the scenes it downloads the packages for the providers and adds the types to your project.
</Segment>

### secret
<Segment>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Subcommands
- <p>[<code class="key">set</code>](#secret-set)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">remove</code>](#secret-remove)</p>
- <p>[<code class="key">list</code>](#secret-list)</p>
</Section>
Manage the secrets in your app defined with `sst.Secret`.
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-set" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">set</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret set <name> <value>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
The name of the secret.
- <p><code class="key">value</code></p>
The value of the secret.
</Section>
Set the value of the secret.

The secrets are encrypted and stored in an S3 Bucket in your AWS account.

For example, set the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret` to `123456789`.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret dev_123456789
```

Optionally, set the secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none"
sst secret set StripeSecret prod_123456789 --stage=production
```
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-remove" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">remove</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret remove <name>
```
</Section>
<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">name</code></p>
The name of the secret.
</Section>
Remove a secret.

For example, remove the `sst.Secret` called `StripeSecret`.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret
```

Optionally, remove a secret in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret remove StripeSecret --stage=production
```
</Segment>
<NestedTitle id="secret-list" Tag="h4" parent="secret ">list</NestedTitle>
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst secret list
```
</Section>
Lists all the secrets.

Optionally, list the secrets in a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst secret list --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### shell
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst shell [command]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">command?</code></p>
A command to run.
</Section>
Run a command with all the resources linked to the environment.

For example, you can run a Node script and use the [JS SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access *all* the linked resources in your app.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const myMainBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyMainBucket");
const myAdminBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyAdminBucket");

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyMainWeb", {
  link: [myMainBucket]
});

new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyAdminWeb", {
  link: [myAdminBucket]
});
```

Now if you run a script.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell node my-script.js
```

It'll have access to all the buckets from above.

```js title="my-script.js"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyMainBucket.name, Resource.MyAdminBucket.name);
```

If no command is passed in, it opens a shell session with the linked resources.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst shell
```

This is useful if you want to run multiple commands, all while accessing the linked resources.
</Segment>

### remove
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst remove
```
</Section>
Removes your application. By default, it removes your personal stage.

:::tip
The resources in your app are removed based on the `removal` setting in your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

Optionally, remove your app from a specific stage.

```bash frame="none" frame="none"
sst remove --stage=production
```
</Segment>

### unlock
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst unlock
```
</Section>
When you run `sst deploy`, it acquires a lock on your state file to prevent concurrent deploys.

However, if something unexpectedly kills the `sst deploy` process, or if you manage to run `sst deploy` concurrently, the lock might not be released.

This should not usually happen, but it can prevent you from deploying. You can run `sst unlock` to release the lock.
</Segment>

### version
<Segment>
<Section type="signature">
```sh frame="none"
sst version
```
</Section>
Prints the current version of the CLI.
</Segment>

### upgrade
<Segment>

sst upgrade [version]
```
</Section>

<Section type="parameters">
#### Args
- <p><code class="key">version?</code></p>
A version to upgrade to.
</Section>
Upgrade the CLI to the latest version. Or optionally, pass in a version to upgrade to.
