title: Client
description: Access linked resources in your handlers in a typesafe way.
---

The Node Client is an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sst) that allows you to access linked resources in your functions and frontends in a typesafe way.

:::note
You'll first need to link a resource to your function or frontend to be able to access it. [Learn more about resource linking](/docs/linking/).
:::

---

## Installation

Install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sst).

```bash
npm install sst@ion
```

:::caution
You need the `@ion` tag to install the Ion version of the SST package.
:::

---

## Usage

Import `Resource` to access the linked resources.

```js title="src/lambda.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";

console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
```

:::tip
The `Resource` object is typesafe and will autocomplete the available resources in your editor.
:::

Here we are assuming that a bucket has been linked to the function. Here's what that could look like.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const myBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");

new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "src/lambda.handler",
  link: [myBucket]
});
```

---

## How it works

In the above example, `Resource.MyBucket.name` works because it's been injected into the function package on `sst dev` and `sst deploy`.

For functions, this is injected into the [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and for frontends, it's injected into the `process.env` object.

The Node client first checks the `process.env` and then the `globalThis` for the linked resources. You can [read more about how the links are injected](/docs/linking/#injecting-links).
