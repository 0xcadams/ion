title: Build an API with SST
description: Create and deploy a serverless API in AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build a serverless API, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS using SST.

Before you get started:

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.sst.dev/advanced/iam-credentials#loading-from-a-file)
2. [Install the SST CLI](/docs/reference/cli)

---

## 1. Create a Node.js app

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
mkdir my-ts-app && cd my-ts-app
npm init -y
```

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app. Make sure you have the [CLI installed](/docs/reference/cli/).

```bash
sst init
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

## 2. Add an API

Let's add an API using [Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
async run() {
  new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2("MyApi")
    .route("GET /", "index.upload")
    .route("GET /latest", "index.latest");
}
```

We are adding two routes, one for uploading an image and another for getting the latest uploaded image.

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode. This runs your functions [_Live_](/docs/live/).

```bash
sst dev
```

This will give you the URL of your API.

```bash frame="none"
✔  Complete
   MyApi: https://y9ink9nh96.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

---

## 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add a `public` S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true
});
```

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the API routes.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {3,7}
new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2("MyApi")
  .route("GET /", {
    link: [bucket],
    handler: "index.upload"
  })
  .route("GET /latest", {
    link: [bucket],
    handler: "index.latest"
  });
```

---

## 4. Upload a file to S3

We want the `/` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to upload a file to our S3 Bucket.

```ts title="index.ts" {4}
export async function upload() {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: await getSignedUrl(s3, command),
  };
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

---

## 5. Download a file from S3

We want the `/latest` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to download the last uploaded file in our S3 Bucket.

```ts title="index.ts"
export async function latest() {
  const objects = await s3.send(
    new ListObjectsV2Command({
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    })
  );

  const latestFile = objects.Contents!.sort(
    (a, b) =>
      (b.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0) - (a.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0)
  )[0];

  const command = new GetObjectCommand({
    Key: latestFile.Key,
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });

  return {
    statusCode: 302,
    headers: {
      Location: await getSignedUrl(s3, command),
    },
  };
}

```

Add the relevant imports.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import {
  S3Client,
  GetObjectCommand,
  PutObjectCommand,
  ListObjectsV2Command,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install sst@ion @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

---

#### Test your app

Let's try uploading a file from your project root. Make sure to use your API URL.

```bash
curl --upload-file package.json "$(curl https://y9ink9nh96.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)"
```

Now head over to `https://y9ink9nh96.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest` in your browser and it'll download the file you just uploaded.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app.

```bash
sst deploy
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can view your app and its logs in the [SST Console](/docs/console/) — [**console.sst.dev**](https://console.sst.dev)

![Next.js in SST Console](../../../../assets/docs/ts-app-in-the-sst-console.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
